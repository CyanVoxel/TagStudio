# Library

The library is how TagStudio represents your chosen directory, with every file inside of it being displayed as an [entry](/doc/Entry.md). You can have as many or few libraries as you wish, since each libraries' data is stored within a "`.TagStudio`" folder at its root.
Note that this means [tags](/doc/Tag.md) you create only exist *per-library*.

### Library contents:
- [Entries](/doc/Entry.md) (v1+)
- [Tags](/doc/Tag.md) (v7+)
- [Fields](/doc/Field.md) (v9+)
- [Macros](/doc/Macro.md) (v9/10+)
